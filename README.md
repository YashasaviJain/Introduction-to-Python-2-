## Aim
To study the basics of **Python programming** including variables, data types,
operators, input/output statements, mathematical functions, and conditional statements.

## Theory
Python is a **high-level, interpreted, and easy-to-learn programming language**.
It is widely used for general programming, data analysis, web development,
and automation.

In this experiment, we learned the **basic concepts of Python**, such as assigning
multiple values to variables and printing output using the `print()` function.
We studied different **data types** like integer, float, string, and boolean,
and identified them using the `type()` function.

We performed **arithmetic operations** such as addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, remainder, and power using operators.
We also learned how to take **user input** using the `input()` function and
convert it into integer or float values.

The program also introduced the use of the **math module** to calculate the
area of a circle and to find logarithmic values.
Finally, we studied **conditional statements (`if-else`)** to compare two numbers
and make decisions.

This experiment helps in understanding the **foundation of Python programming**.
